    "### What is the problem you are attempting to solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "With the internet becoming increasingly involved in the average person's daily life, many companies have taken to ecommerce, which is the electronic sale of goods through the internet. In order for an entrepreneur to break into the ecommerce market or for a large company to add to their sources of revenue, a niche market must be found. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of clarity in this project, a niche market will be defined using this Wikipedia description:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"A niche market is the subset of the market on which a specific product is focused. The market niche defines as the product features aimed at satisfying specific market needs, as well as the price range, production quality, and the demographics that is intended to impact. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The niche market is highly specialized, and aiming(sic) to survicve among the competition from numerous super companies. Even established companies create products for different niches, for example, Hewlett-Packard has all-in-one machines for printing, scanning, and faxing targeted for the home office niche while at the same time having separate machines with one of these functions for big businesses.\" \n",
    "    \n",
    "With this definition in mind, the problem will be defined as, \"With competition saturating the ecommerce market, what is the best niche market for a business or entrepreneur to expand into?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "To narrow the scope of this project, the focus will be on electronics appliances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is your solution valuable?\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this project will be a solution that exceeds the competition (other niche market research tools) in terms of finding the ideal niche market in a given sector. The ideal niche market is one that has a combination of high search volume, has products that are difficult for consumers to find locally, solves a common problem or has a customer base that is passionate, is not overrun with websites that have a PageRank of five or higher (see appendix), and has accessible suppliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution will drastically reduce the amount of hours and wages spent for market research and will be a valuable tool for anyone in ecommerce, from large companies to individual entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is your data source and how will you access it?\n",
    "##### Links to sources in appendix\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Information - Facebook, Google News, Google Trends, and Twitter APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competition Research - PageRank Status for Chrome\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What techniques from the course do you anticipate using?\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will begin with a broad search of keywords related to technology appliances on Keyword Planner (see appendix). For example, a keyword search was conducted for \"Consumer Electronics Appliances\" that returned seven hundred keywords with information on their average monthly searches and their level of competition (Low, Medium, or High). This information will be downloaded and filtered to generate a list of keywords that have a high number of average monthly searches and a low rank of competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Google trends will then be used to compare the search trends of the keywords against each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Go into further detail on the execution \n",
    "\n",
    "## Need to explain how the sources will work together\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution will start with a broad search of keywords related to technology appliances on Google Trends. This data will be collected, and techniques from the Time Series section of Thinkful will be used to model the seasonality of items. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this information, the keywords list will be narrowed down and will be used to scrape social media to find the products with the highest interest. This will be accomplished by utilizing Unsupervised Neural Networks to perform Natural Language Processing to determine consumer sentiment of the various products. \n",
    "\n",
    "The insights drawn from the NLP technique will become additional features from which a Supervised Neural Network will create a model to predict the rise in consumer interest for a product. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the predicted value that we test against? What are the features you will use?\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model will be validated for accuracy by comparing the products that were classified as rising in interest to a value pulled from Google Trends that is the increase in interest in the next six months. That is, for Product A at Time T, the data for search interest will be analyzed for time T through T + 6 months. If the model classified the product as rising in interest and the data shows that the model rose by a certain threshold percent (to be determined once the data has been collected), then the model was accurate in classifying that product at time T. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What do you anticipate will be the biggest challenge you'll face?\n",
    "Narrowing the scope of searches so that it is not too computationally intense. This can be mitigated by using Google Trends and Google News to refine the list of products to scrape social media for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competition - This will require some research into how saturated the market is for a given product. Facebook will be a useful tool to collect information on competitors in the same market, including how many fans they have, how engaged people are with their product, and what products are liked or disliked the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonality - Since seasonality can have a large impact on the interest in season-specific items (e.g. swimsuits in Spring / Summer, jackets in Fall / Winter), the seasonality of certain products will be taken into consideration.\n",
