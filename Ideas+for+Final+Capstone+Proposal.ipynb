    "Copied from the proposal sent to me by company, R Zero.\n",

    "We call Doppler \"the Health Forecast\" - it's an app on your phone that you open up to see any health risks for where you are today. We've done the conceptual work and are now ready to move into real development.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want you to help us create a system that retrieves information from a variety of sources through an RSS feed and processes it so the information can be smoothly incorporated into our platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we want an application that:\n",
    "* Retrieves information from an RSS feed for\n",
    "    * Locations (for example, an article that mentioned Zika in the US would mention Miami Beach, Florida - we need that)\n",
    "        * And, ideally processes the location for a geo-coordinate (latitude/longitude)\n",
    "    * Diseases/Conditions (such as Zika, the flu, etc)\n",
    "    * Number of cases, if included\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Records the information into an easily accessible format (a CSV file would be great for now)\n",
    "    * Include the processed information and the link to the source\n",
    "\n",
    "* Has thorough code comments throughout, so developers that extend it in the future can understand the logic behind it.\"\n",

    "### What is your data source and how will you access it?\n",
    "Data wil be gathered by scraping Google News API to get URLs to articles that discuss the onset, diagnoses, spread, etc. of disease. The articles will be scraped for locations, disease and conditions, and number of cases.\n",

    "### What techniques from the course do you anticipate using?\n",
    "Scraping to get the data as described above.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Supervised Neural Networks to create a regression model that predicts the likelihood of a disease spreading to an area depending on its distance from the current outbreak. \n",

    "Getting reliable data from the scraping process.\n",
